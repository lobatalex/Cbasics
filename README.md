# Cbasics

The aim of this repository is to store algorithms developed throughout my Systems Engeneering course, which were developed in C
for the Computer Science subjects, at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG).
I hope this will also aid others students, wether they're study Systems Engeneering or not, to get through the hardships of 
programming.

All the code uploaded to this repository will be in C language and made as generalist as I can conceive it, so it may be modified to suit any othe user neeeds.
